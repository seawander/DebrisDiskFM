The files in this folder are to make sure your MPI code of MCMC works in a Slurm cluster. 

The test example is from http://dfm.io/emcee/current/user/line/ to demonstrate the MPI capability of EMCEE with line fitting

Python Scripts:
    Scenario 1. ``test.py'' is a single-core calcuation of MCMC
    Scenario 2. ``test_mpi.py'' is an MPI calculation of MCMC

Job Submission:
    1. Submit ``test.py'' with
        ``sbatch slurm_job_example_single_core''

    2. Submit ``test_mpi.py'' with
        ``sbatch slurm_job_example_mpi''
        
    3. If you want to use multi-core computing but on a single node (somewhere between Scenario 1 and Scenario 2), replace the MPI example's Pool line with
        ``from multiprocessing import Pool''
       and the ``with MPIPool()'' with ``with Pool()''
       
       Then edit the MPI submission script as
       ``#SBATCH --nodes=1 
         #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16 ## using 16 cores on this node
       ''
